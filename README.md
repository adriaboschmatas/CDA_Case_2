ABSTRACT
With this report, we aim to use Exploratory Data Analysis to compare K-means and Hierarchical Agglomerative
Clustering to identify patterns between physiological signals, emotional status, and stress using the EmoPairCompete
dataset. While stress-related physiological responses were inconclusive across experiment phases, self-reported emotional
states indicated higher frustration and activity during stressinducing phases. The findings highlight potential disparities
between perceived stress and physiological responses, suggesting a need for further research to refine stress biomarkers
and clustering methods.
